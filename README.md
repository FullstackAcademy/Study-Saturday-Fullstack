## Lecture Slides: [Study-Saturday-Fullstack](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HqPEArZWmkBqjLHm_cLUQyRisEyEJxpRfbG-iatEYLs/edit?usp=sharing)

## **Objective:** Build a form to add new students to our app
- [x] **Cycle 0:** Create a route for adding students
- [x] **Cycle 1:** Create and render a form
- [ ] **Cycle 2:** Update state with form input ⭐️
- [ ] **Cycle 3:** Make the form functional
- [ ] **Cycle 4 (Bonus):** Refactor

### Steps

- In the `NewStudentForm` component, do the following:
  - [ ] Add a local state (you will have to determine the necessary data we will need to house in `this.state`)
  - [ ] Add a `handleChange` method that will update the `state` according to the form's input
  - [ ] Add a `handleSubmit` method that will take the data from `state` and ***do*** something with it (you can surmise what that something is) ***and*** clear the `state` (and thus the form)
- [ ] Once done and tested, `git checkout cycle-3`
