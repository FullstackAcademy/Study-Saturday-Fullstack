## **Objective:** Build a form to add new students to our app
- [x] **Cycle 0:** Create a route for adding students
- [ ] **Cycle 1:** Create and render a form ⭐️
- [ ] **Cycle 2:** Update state with form input
- [ ] **Cycle 3:** Make the form functional
- [ ] **Cycle 4 (Bonus):** Refactor

### Steps

- [ ] Create a button that reads, "Add New Student," in the `Main` component
  - The button should "toggle" the form
  - The form should be "hidden"
    - You can go about this a couple of different ways
- [ ] Create a new component (in its own file) called "`NewStudentForm`," that will render a form with ***three*** input fields (First Name, Last Name and Email) and a way to submit (i.e. either `<button>` _or_ `<input type="submit">`)
